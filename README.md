## General info
This project involves the analysis study of results for several promising anti-cancer drugs. The briefing note was as follows:  
  
*While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that science was the way for you. Staying true to your mission, you've joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.  
As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study resulte*

## Setup
* Open the Pymaceuticals directory
* This contains the Pymaceuticals.ipynb which can be opened as a Jupyter Notebook
* A resources folder is also present which contains the necessary base data
* Once Pymaceuticals.ipynb is loaded as a Jupyter Notebook, Select *Restart & Run All* from Kernel menu 
* The Notebook can now be navigated using the links to observe the data analysis

## Features
The following analyses are included in Pymaceuticals:  
  
* Data Cleaning
* Summary Statistics
* Quartiles and Outliers
* Bar Charts - Mouse counts through the study
* Pie Charts - Male vs female mice
* Line Plot - Example individial line plot of mouse tumor volume vs time
* Scatter Plot - Average tumor volume vs mouse weight
* Correlation and Linear Regression - For average tumor volume vs mouse weight

## Status
Project is: <span style="color:green">*COMPLETED*</span>.
